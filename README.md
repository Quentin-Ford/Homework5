Homework 5 for CS 3714

The app consists of two activities, the first containing just a start button which takes a picture when pressed. Once a photo is made, the second activity starts with it as the background. There are six buttons at the bottom, three for selecting the marker color (blue by default) and three others for undoing a line, clearing the picture, and the last for finishing with the drawing. Touching the screen will result in a line being draw according to the selected color in real time. Icons can also be added to the scrren by either double tapping to add a hokie bird, or by long pressing to add a star. Pressing the undo button will erase the most recent line added but not the icons while pressing clear will get rid of everything on the screen besides the picture including the icons. Finally, selecting done will exit the drawing activity and bring the user back to the start screen where they can choose to take a new picture if they wish.

### Notes
The biggest challenge to me with this project was figuring out how to add the icons at random points on the screen, but I eventually figured it out. The only functionality 
that I was not able to make in this project was for the multitouch controls. Even though multiple touches were detected at once, only one line would be drawn at a time.
